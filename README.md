# Diabetes-Prediction-WebApp-using-Streamlit

#### Steps to run the project:

Step 1: Download the ipynb file and load the dataset in it.

Step 2: Run the file to get 'trained_model.sav' on your colab directory.

Step 3: Create a folder named 'Diabetes Prediction' and store the trained_model file in it.

Step 4: Open Anaconda and create new environment named as 'MachineLearning'

Step 5: In the MachineLearning environment, open terminal and download streamlit and sklearn using:

        streamlit:
        i) pip install streamlit
        ii) streamlit hello
        
        sklearn:
        i) pip install sklearn

Step 6: After installing the libraries, open 'Diabetes-prediction-webapp.py' and store it in 'Diabetes Prediction' folder

Step 7: Copy the path of 'Diabetes-prediction-webapp.py'

Step 8: Open terminal of MachineLearning environment and run the command:

        streamlit run "..[path]..\Diabetes-prediction-webapp.py"
        
Step 9: Enter all the user inputs required 

Step 10: Click on Predict button inorder to predict whether a person is 'Diabetic' or 'Not Diabetic'
